  # = Themes
  #
  # Themes are used to customize the appearance of sites. They combine any
  # number of view templates, a custom layout (optional), Javascript and
  # Stylesheets. Technically themes are Rails engines and as such may also
  # contain custom code in the form of controllers, models and custom routes.
  #
  #
  # == Templates
  #
  # Templates are normal Rails partials written using ERb or Haml (or any other
  # Rails-compatible view layer, just declare the relevant dependencies in your gemspec).
  #
  # In your Theme, declare templates template method:
  #
  #   # templates declaring body: false do not have their own content and
  #   # are exempted from fulltext search. Use this flag for post listings and
  #   # other special page types that do not have their own content.
  #   template :homepage, body: false
  #   template :homepage_with_greeting, body: false, for: :homepage, fields: %w(greeting)
  #
  #   # A template for listing posts by tag. This one has a body text, but we
  #   # still don't want to have this kind of index page found by fulltext
  #   # search:
  #   template :tag, fulltext_search: false
  #   template :page
  #   template :page_alternate, for: :page
  #   template :post
  #
  # Bold tries to guess which template to use as a default based on the
  # template name (first argument). These 'well known' template names are:
  #
  # * +homepage+ Homepage template
  # * +tag+ Template for the result of a tag search
  # * +archive+ Template for archive display (either by month or year)
  # * +post+ Post template
  # * +page+ Page template
  #
  # Template names have to be unique per theme and for each declared template
  # there needs to be a corresponding view template with a matching name:
  # +app/vies/themes/theme_name/_template_name.html.{haml,erb}+
  #
  # In order to declare more than one template for a given usage, you may specify
  # the intended use using the +for+ option as can be seen above with the
  # +homepage_with_greeting+ and +page_alternate+ templates.
  #
  # Templates that do not render their content's body (usually these are the
  # list kind templates like tag, archive or homepage) should declare so using
  # +body: false+.
  #
  # === Template fields
  #
  # Use the +fields+ option to declare any fields that instances of this template
  # should have. You also have to provide a partial named +_templatename+ in
  # a +fields+ subdirectory of your theme's template directory.
  # in this case, which renders the form html for these fields. This partial
  # will get a SimpleForm Formbuilder instance as local variable +f+ and will
  # be rendered in the sidebar of the editing view.
  #
  #
  # == View Hooks
  #
  # == Layout
  #
  # By default, all templates are rendered with Bold's +content+ layout, which
  # does nothing more than render HTML boilerplate, call any declared hooks in
  # the right places and render the template. When using this layout, common
  # html code like header and footer is usually placed in view hooks to avoid
  # duplication.
  #
  # You can however also give your theme a custom layout (derive it from the
  # default layout to not miss any of the Bold methods inserting meta data and
  # hook content). When named +layout.html.erb+ or +layout.html.haml+ this
  # layout will be discovered and used automatically, if you prefer a different
  # name declare the layout explicitly:
  #
  #     # expects the file at
  #     # app/views/themes/<theme_id>/my_custom_layout.html.{haml,erb}
  #     layout :my_custom_layout
  #
  # == Theme Assets
  #
  # == I18n
  #
  # == Routes
