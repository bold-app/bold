Bold [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bold-app/bold.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bold-app/bold)
====

For blogging. And small web sites. Maybe even big web sites. Who knows.


Requirements
------------

- Ruby 2.3
- PostgreSQL 9.x with `hstore` extension.



Running the tests
-----------------

    bundle install
    bundle exec rake db:setup
    bundle exec rake


### Integration tests

Some integration tests use poltergeist / phantomjs for javascript enabled test
runs. In order for these to work, first map test.host to your local machine in
`/etc/hosts`:

    127.0.0.1 localhost test.host

Then install a phantomjs binary if you are on a Mac, or compile it yourself if
you are on Linux. See http://phantomjs.org/download.html .
